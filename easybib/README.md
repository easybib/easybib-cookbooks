## easybib\_config
easybib_config is a helper to provide app-accessible configuration from chef. During deploy, it renders `.deploy_configuration.sh`, `.deploy_configuration.ini` and `.deploy_configuration.php` - all of them containing the same configuration data in various formats.

Example: .deploy_configuration.php:

```
<?php
return [
  'deployed_application' => [
    'appname'=>"some_app",
    'domains'=>"app.example.tld  app.local",
    'app_dir'=>"/srv/www/foo-app/",
    'deploy_dir'=>"/srv/www/foo-app/current/",
  ],
  'deployed_stack' => [
    'stackname'=>"opsworks-stack",
    'environment'=>"playground",
  ],
  'settings' => [
    'RANDOM_ENVVAR_DIR'=>"/tmp/foo",
  ],
];
```

### deployed_application
* appname: The application name (short_name in opsworks)
* domains: The domain(s), if more than one, concatenated with space
* app_dir: The application root directory (you usually want to use deploy_dir, though, see below)
* deploy_dir: The directory the application has been deployed to. On vagrant, this is the same as app_dir, on opsworks, it is appdir/current/

### deployed_stack
* stackname: the stacks shortname
* environment: environment - playground/production on opsworks, vagrant on vagrant (might be helpful for automatic decision which config to use)

### settings
Application specific settings. Those are taken from the stack json, node[appname]['env']. The containing array has all keys flattened and uppercased (since not all output formats support multidimensional arrays).

For example, this stack json:

```
    "env": {
      "dir": {
        "tmp": "/tmp"
      },
      "aws": {
        "access_key": "FOO",
        "secret_key": "BAR"
      }
    }
 ```

 will result in

 ```
   'settings' => [
    'ENV_DIR_TMP'=>"/tmp",
    'AWS_ACCESS_KEY'=>"FOO",
    'AWS_SECRET_KEY'=>"BAR",
  ],
 ```

 ## Stack Settings for Vagrant

 ```
 {
   "vagrant": {
     "applications": {
       "application_shortname": {
         "app_root_location": "/some_directory",
         "doc_root_location": "/some_directory/www",
         "domain_name": "my-domain.local"
       }
     }
   },
   "application_shortname": {
     "env": {
       "random_envvar": "foo"
     }
   }
 }
 ```
